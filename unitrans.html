            Overview
        </h2>
        <p>
            My team took on this project to redesign the UnitransNow app for UC Davis students who need assistance with navigating the bus system run by ASUCD (Associated Students of UC Davis). Our goal was to simplify useful features from the current app while incorporating elements of other resources that students use to navigate the bus system.

            Process
        </h2>
        <p>
            We focused on user research because we wanted to understand the pain points that make it difficult for students to know when their bus is arriving or leaving. In sending surveys and doing a competitive analysis, we wanted to get a better idea of which app functions were confusing or not helpful. From there, we made the features as intuitive as possible so students wouldnâ€™t have to juggle with multiple navigation apps to figure out arrival predications or how to get from one location to another. During my week as the sprint lead, my responsibilities consisted of ensuring that we had a design system to ensure consistency across all our pages, and maintain the process of developing our final high fidelity prototypes.
