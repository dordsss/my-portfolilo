    <h2 class="int">hello!</h2>
    <p>
        My name is Dorothy Hung and I’m currently a second-year Design and Communications major, also pursuing a minor in Education. Studying at a public research university and one of the only UC’s with a program solely dedicated to design, I’ve spent the past two years navigating the different disciplines of design offered at my school. I initially came in wanting to do graphic design and public relations, but eventually I discovered the rapidly growing field of UI/UX that holds the perfect combination of empathizing with users through the human-centered aspect while also developing an eye for aesthetics.

        After picking up a minor, I found myself delving into the world of learning design and how that looks in an era where technology and interest-based learning is starting to impact the direction of education. I’ve never felt more excited about my coursework in seeing the overlap between my classes, and I hope that passion and energy can be translated through some of the projects (both professional and passion) here on this page. Take a look around, make yourself at home!
