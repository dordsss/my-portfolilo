        <p class="sideheader">Goal was to make a poster that was not only visually appealing but that communicates the message of an important event. Here is a new take on marketing for the TEDx Event... from 2015</p>

    <h2 class="ted">Challenge</h2>
    <p>
        The challenge of this assignment was to create a design using graphics and typography to promote a past event. For my poster I wanted to create a statement piece that would not only attract a crowd but would speak for itself and leave the audience thinking about the message or purpose of the event.

    <h2 class="ted">Process</h2>
    <p>
        This advertisement focused on emphasizing the branding of this event in hopes that the minimal, yet bold design would capture the targeted audience’s attention. The strokes of the “X” were strategically placed in alignment with the text so that the viewer’s gaze would naturally follow the direction of the visual elements and pick up on the important details of the event.  The logos at the bottom contrast with the subtle background just enough so that students could recognize them and perceive that this was a partnership between a well-known organization and the university.
