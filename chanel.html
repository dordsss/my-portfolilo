    <h2 class="cc">Overview</h2>
    <p>
        Our client, who works as a Designer and Researcher at Kaiser Permanente, shared about the imbalance between personal check-ins and productive work at their department meetings, which in turn causes many of her colleagues to feel distant and unmotivated to participate. We wanted to find ways to bring their ideal work environment/culture into working from home while adding an element of surprise to these activities/game cards.  
    </p>

    <h2 class="cc">Problem</h2>
    <p>
        These themed activity and game cards are designed to help set the mood during the meeting, as our client expressed how easily her colleagues can feel drained when coming onto a call. Since these cards can be sent out as deliverables ahead of time, we suggest that people not only partake in the game portion but that they prepare to dress up for that meeting based on that week’s chosen theme – another added layer of visual stimulation (aside from these graphics I had designed) which our client had mentioned was lacking in their meetings. In regards to people turning their cameras off during the meeting, we made it a requirement in each game where all participants must have their cameras on the whole time in order to keep one another accountable of paying attention and being involved in the activity.
