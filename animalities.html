        Overview
    </h2>
    <p>
        In designing an interactive learning object for a UHP integrated studies class, my group and I geared our project towards the toddler to pre-adolescence age range, or the period when children are starting to learn social skills and cues. Although the assignment was supposed to be about one of the standard subjects taught in K-12 education, we deviated from the prompt (with teacher permission) and focused on how young children come to understand empathy and perspective-taking through the development of Theory of Mind.

        Process
    </h2>
    <p>
        We constructed our game around a simplified version of the Big 5 Personality traits because children may struggle to recognize how they act or think differently than their peers in certain scenarios. I created these graphics and visuals, which were mainly intended to hold the child’s attention, but also worked with my partner to add short biographies of each animal based on their individual assigned traits – we decided that this would allow players to further connect with the characters and engage during the game through role-play. The participants start off by keeping their identity a secret, but overtime they provide clues to others as they grow into their character; the hope is to encourage them to practice being both vulnerable about their emotions and also receptive of other players’ openness to sharing.
