    <h2 class="ev">Problem</h2>
    <p>
        Students transitioning into UC Davis, or even just college for that matter, run into many pain points during their first year. For many people, getting adjusted to a new environment and figuring out where they can be the most productive is one of many challenging aspects they face during their first year. This app was designed to help students get acclimated to campus and find new study spaces that fit their needs, and explore new places on campus they never knew about!  
    </p>
    <h2 class="ev">Concept</h2>
    <p>
        The goal of this app is to provide students with a resource where they can virtually explore different areas on campus that other students enjoy studying at. In a way, this is like Google Maps where students can get a 360 "view" of study halls and other facilities on campus. Since student housing can be a bit of a ways from the main parts of campus, students can use eNVISION 360 to check out a new study space before making the trek over. They can also filter out their preferences when looking for a new workspace - we are all about customized experiences and user-centered design!
